## TODO

in order of what i think is useful
- `/analyses` sql scripts are not actually useable. They have a weird wrapper from DBT
- Can you run 
- Play around with some snapshots (maybe)

# Macros seem dumb
- Look at macros
- Jinja looks lame

# Dagster is complicated
I have no clue why you would use dagster. Also issues with using dagster for w/e reason. Issue with the pendulum package
- Look at how airflow or dagster would be used with DBT

## Census related
- Identify what is doable for AIES and others.

- Multiple database types. Can imagine postgres, redshift, etc. as potential ones.
