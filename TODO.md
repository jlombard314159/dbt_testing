in order of what i think is useful
- Look at cal-itp uses scripts: https://github.com/cal-itp/data-infra/tree/main/warehouse/scripts
- Play around with some snapshots (maybe)

# These seem dumb
- Look at macros

# Dagster is complicated
I have no clue why you would use dagster. Also issues with using dagster for w/e reason. Issue with the pendulum package
- Look at how airflow or dagster would be used with DBT

## Census related
