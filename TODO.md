## TODO

in order of what i think is useful
- `/analyses` sql scripts are not actually useable. They have a weird wrapper from DBT
- Play around with some snapshots (maybe)

- Implement a transformation macro
- finish the geo example

# airflow
- Figure out how to identify if airflow is working?

# soda
- No sqlite support which makes sense so try @ census instead.

## Census related
- Identify what is doable for AIES and others.

- figure out airflow at census
- Multiple database types. Can imagine postgres, redshift, etc. as potential ones.
